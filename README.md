# Predicting-symptoms-trajctories-of-metal-health
Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting mental health symptom trajectories using mobile sensing data. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze behavioral patterns and forecast symptom development, enabling better mental health management and intervention strategies.

Dataset

The dataset, titled CrossCheck_Daily_Data.xlsx, consists of daily data from mobile sensing applications. It includes:

Rows: 23,573 (representing daily records).

Columns: 155 (comprising various metrics like activity levels, app usage, and unlock events).

Key Features:

study_id: Unique identifier for each participant.

eureka_id: Another unique identifier, possibly anonymized.

day: Date of the record.

Activity Metrics: Data on activities like time spent in vehicles, on bikes, etc.

Unlock Metrics: Frequency and duration of phone unlock events.

Others: Various other behavioral metrics related to app usage and movement patterns.

Known Issues:

Large Data Size: The dataset is extensive and computationally heavy.

Potential Errors: Outliers and extreme values exist in columns like unlock_duration_ep_* and unlock_num_ep_*.

Missing Values: No significant missing data was detected, but further validation is recommended.

Setup and Requirements

Prerequisites:

Python: Version 3.8 or above.

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

jupyter (optional, for notebook-based analysis)

Installation:

To set up the environment, install the required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter

Preprocessing Steps

Data Cleaning:

Handle missing or inconsistent data.

Detect and address outliers.

Feature Engineering:

Normalize continuous variables.

Encode categorical variables (if any).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize data distributions.

Identify correlations between features and the target variable.

Feature Selection:

Remove irrelevant or redundant columns.

Use techniques like PCA for dimensionality reduction.

Running the Code

Load the Dataset:
Ensure the dataset is in the working directory or provide the full path in the script.

Run Preprocessing:
Use the data_preprocessing.py module (to be created) to clean and preprocess the data.

Train Models:
Experiment with models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks for prediction.

Expected Outcomes

Insights into key factors affecting mental health symptom trajectories.

A predictive model with high accuracy and robustness.

Visualizations for easy interpretation of results.
